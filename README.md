üéØ *Creating a map of contemporary structures built in Hamburg since 2014 was the main goal of the project. If you feel you have seen everything Hamburg has to offer, this map could be advantageous in uncovering more of the city's architectural treasures!*

üí° *Brief explanations of the projects featured provide an overview of the buildings. This may be of interest to architects looking for a fresh perspective on the city. It is also an excellent opportunity to learn about the firms and architects who were involved in these projects.*

## How to use

Use the map to navigate through the architectural wonders of Hamburg's Day of Architecture provided by the [Architekten- und Ingenieurkammer Hamburg](https://www.akhh.de/). The collection includes projects developed since 2014, as well as some iconic structures from the city's earlier years. 

Click on a building for detailed information and a handy button that links to the Google Maps route planner for easy navigation.
