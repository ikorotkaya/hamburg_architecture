## How it works

üîë Please make sure you have set up your Google Maps API key correctly to access Google Maps. You can find detailed instructions on obtaining and configuring your API key in the [Google Maps JavaScript API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

üè† New buildings will be added to this project every year after the "Tag der Architektur" event in Hamburg.

üîé Project info sourced from website and PDFs via a JavaScript script. Access the [Hamburg Architecture Data Scraper](https://github.com/ikorotkaya/web_scraper) for usage instructions, including connecting the app to a PostgreSQL database using ORM Sequelize.

üó£Ô∏è Switch between English and German using the language button in the top-right corner. Project titles and descriptions are translated using the i18next package.

Optional:

üåê Connect the app to a server for dynamic project updates. The server, built with Express.js and PostgreSQL, allows adding projects to the map without redeploying the app. Check *server.ts* in the root directory for the server code.

‚ùóÔ∏è Secure your confidential data in the env file using dotenv for server-to-database connectivity. Refer to the [Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) for setup details.
